title: "About Me"
layout: about
introduction: |
  I was born in Lisbon with a passion to discover the world. For most of my life I lived in one of the most sunny and welcoming cities in the world. I've spent time in the land of pasta and gelato and the land of whisky and kilts. Now based in one of the most diverse cities in the world - London. No matter where I am, in my spare time you can find me:

  - In the tea isle (green tea lover)
  - Having a pistachio ice cream
  - Trying out new Middle Eastern restaurants
  - Looking for new recipes to try out
  - Exploring the world
  - Baking
  - Looking for flights
  - Reading
